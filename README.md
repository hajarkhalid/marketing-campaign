Correlation analysis to determine relationships between demographic features and purchases.
Segmentation
Use K-Means or other clustering methods to segment customers based on behavior.
Campaign Analysis
Track the effectiveness of various campaigns by analyzing customer responses.
Investigate which customer groups are more likely to respond to campaigns.
Predictive Modeling (optional)
Apply logistic regression or decision tree models to predict future campaign responses.
Insights
Certain customer segments (e.g., higher-income, younger individuals) are more likely to respond to campaigns.
Specific marketing channels or offer types (e.g., discounts) have higher conversion rates.
Patterns in customer behavior, such as frequent small purchases, can be used for targeted advertising.
